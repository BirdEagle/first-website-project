                        My species, the majestic bird, is the only bird with large teeth. I am the only bird that walks and hops, thus, the only bird that flies. My wings are used in hunting, transportation, and the creation of nests. They are used to help support our bodies. My wings allow me to be a strong, swift bird. My beak is used in my diet. I use it to pierce flesh, tear things apart, and crush food. My claws are used in defense. I use them to fight for my food, or to catch prey. My talons are used for digging nests and making homes. My breast is used in creating my nest. I use my breast feathers to construct my nest, and in mating. My feathers are used in keeping me warm. My feathers are used in communicating with my parents. My feet are used for running and balancing.

                        I have been a bird, specifically eagle, for quite some time now. I can't be any other way. It just seems that way. I don't mean to be arrogant about it. I have been this bird, specifically eagle, for as long as I can remember. I have also been in other forms of life. But none, that I have experienced so far, have felt quite the same. I can't explain it. It's just how I am. It's a part of me, a part of my life, a part of my story. There are things about this body that are simply what I am. I can't not be them. I don't think I have a choice.

                        One day, while walking through the forest behind my nest, I stumbled across an old abandoned hawkâ€™s nest. It was just a big hole in a tree, nothing special, but I was intrigued. I remember it smelled nice, a bit like the nests my parents used to build, only this smelled newer. I found it on my way back from the old lake to the nest and I decided to take a look. I looked inside and saw the remains of a bird who died when he was young, and they were already starting to grow in their own nests. I remember being intrigued. The problem with birds is that they are incredibly beautiful. And if I am being honest, I would also say I did a little dreaming. Dreaming of the day when I would be sitting in a majestic aerie and I could fly from my perch and soar through the clouds and catch a bird in mid-air. But you know, I am not really that stupid. I had to do things before they would be possible for me to do.
